The following is a summary of [this README](https://github.com/jadc/modpack-manifest-generator/blob/master/README.md)

1. Write mod ids in `mods.txt`, separating each mod with a new line.  
   Comments work too, prefixed with `#`

2. Ensure python is installed, and double-click `generate.py`

3. Check the terminal for any errors.

4. Your manifest.json is generated.

P.S. You shouldn't need to edit the manifest-template.json. Contact the other contributers before you do.
